# Ocarina of Time Items Only Tracker Pack for EmoTracker.

  This tracker pack was made for EmoSaru's EmoTracker and requires it to run. You can find it at [the EmoTracker discord](https://goo.gl/XG844K).

  This pack features icons for every item in Ocarina of Time Randomizer, but doesn't include a map showing what chests are available.

# Some tips to get the most out of the tracker:

 - Items that have capacity upgrades are progressive. Simply left-click the icon again to increase the number on the icon. These items include the slingshot, bombs, bow, deku nuts, sticks, skulltulas and bottles.
  
 - Other items are also progressive and work the same way. You'll always obtain these in the same order in-game. These items include the ocarinas, hookshot/longshot, lift upgrades, zora scales, and the adult and kid trading quests.
  
 - The song icons can be right-clicked to add a checkmark. Because songs are shuffled amongst each other, these can be used to indicate which song locations you've gotten a song from.
    
 - The section at the botton with dungeon names serves two purposes. Left- or right-clicking on the question mark icons will cycle through all the spiritual stones and medallions, allowing you to mark which dungeons they're in when you find the in-game hint. The numbers represent the number of randomized items you can find in each dungeon. Please note that these numbers do not include keys, maps, or compasses, meaning the number of total chests is higher than the numbers shown.
    
  - The bottle icon can be right-clicked to add an indicator that you've found Ruto's letter in a bottle. This item is guaranteed to be found in one of the 4 bottles, but not necessarily the first one you find, so marking that can be a good reminder.
		
# Customization
		
   The tracker can be customized any way you like. This requires using EmoTracker to export a copy of the tracker layout and/or broadcast layout JSONs. In EmoTracker, click the gear icon, then `Packages>Export Overrides` and choose either Tracker Layout or Broadcast Layout. This will clone the JSONs from the zip file and place them `Documents/EmoTracker/user_overrides/ootrando_itemsonly_jrjathome`. Using a text editor, you can customize icon size, background color, and even the order of the icons. EmoTracker will always load files from that folder first, and only load files from the zip file that don't already exist in that folder.
   
The pack has a few additional items that have been coded, but are not used in the default layout for various reasons. When customizing the tracker, you can easily add these items to the layout if you wish.  Check the txt file in the zip file called 'Additional items for customizing your tracker.txt' for more information on how to do this and what items are available.
